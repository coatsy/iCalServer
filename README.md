# iCalServer

iCalServer is a sample dotNet Core WebAPI implementation of a service serving [iCal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) Calendars.

Much of the structure for the code was taken from a 2012 blog post on [serving ics requests from SharePoint](https://arunjameskc.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/implementing-custom-sharepoint-icalendar-ics-requests-using-httphandler/).
